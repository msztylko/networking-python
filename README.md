Exploration of networking concepts in Python

## Notebooks
* [sockets.ipynb](./sockets.ipynb) - first exploration, very basic concepts
* [network-cookbook.ipynb](./network-cookbook.ipynb) - networking recipes based on first chapters of Python Network Programming Cookbook. Book feels quite dated, so I didn't follow it too much.
* [more-networks.ipynb](./more-networks.ipynb) - the most in-depth exploration based on [Python Network Programming course by David Beazley](http://www.dabeaz.com/python/PythonNetBinder.pdf) which I cannot recommend enough!

## Others
* [scripts/](./scripts) - smaller programs used by notebooks
* [async-server.py](./async-server.py) - minimal async TCP server example

## Next steps
While Python might be a good tool for network programming once you know the domain, it doesn't feel too good for learning networking. I want to learn this topic more with some different resources.
